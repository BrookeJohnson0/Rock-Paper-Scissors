# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This Python program is a simulation game of 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'. The user will be asked how many rounds they want to play,  and the computer will simulate a round based on the number given. The program will detail who cast what, and who won each individual round.  The player with the most victories wins the match.
